| Welcome to puppeth, your Ethereum private network manager |
|                                                           |
| This tool lets you create a new Ethereum network down to  |
| the genesis block, bootnodes, miners and ethstats servers |
| without the hassle that it would normally entail.         |
|                                                           |
| Puppeth uses SSH to dial in to remote servers, and builds |
| its network components out of Docker containers using the |
| docker-compose toolset.                                   |

Sweet, you can set this via --network=ChainSkills next time!

WARN [04-26|20:10:49] No previous configurations found         path=/home/deltonmyalil/.puppeth/ChainSkills

What would you like to do? (default = stats)
 1. Show network stats
 2. Configure new genesis
 3. Track new remote server
 4. Deploy network components
> 2

###We need to configure a new genesis node, hence choose 2


Which consensus engine to use? (default = clique)
 1. Ethash - proof-of-work
 2. Clique - proof-of-authority
> 1

###We use ethash

Which accounts should be pre-funded? (advisable at least one)
> 0x

###We are not prefunding anything, so hit enter

Specify your chain/network ID if you want an explicit one (default = random)
> 4224 

###Network ID should not be 1/2/3/4/42 as they are reserved, hence give something like 4224

INFO [04-26|20:20:59] Configured new genesis block 

###We created our genesis block and now we need to export it into a file
###Use manage existing genesis>>>Export genesis configuration>>>Hit enter to save as default name ChainSkills.json

What would you like to do? (default = stats)
 1. Show network stats
 2. Manage existing genesis
 3. Track new remote server
 4. Deploy network components
> 2

 1. Modify existing fork rules
 2. Export genesis configuration
 3. Remove genesis configuration
> 2

Which file to save the genesis into? (default = ChainSkills.json)
> 
INFO [04-26|20:23:14] Exported existing genesis block 

###After this it goes back to the initial menu

What would you like to do? (default = stats)
 1. Show network stats
 2. Manage existing genesis
 3. Track new remote server
 4. Deploy network components

###Now thats all we need to do with puppeth - make a .json genesis export to the disk
###Quit puppeth with Ctrl+C

> ^C
deltonmyalil@ubuntu:~/ChainSkills/private$ ls

###Now when I list the content in the private folder, we can see ChainSkills.json file
ChainSkills.json
deltonmyalil@ubuntu:~/ChainSkills/private$ 

###Open it in atom
deltonmyalil@ubuntu:~/ChainSkills/private$ atom ChainSkills.json

###Quit atom after checking it and use geth

deltonmyalil@ubuntu:~/ChainSkills/private$ geth --datadir . init ChainSkills.json

###Here in the above command, "." means this directory itself
###Initialize the BC, It makes two folders in the private directory

###See that everything got init successfully. Two new folders are created. "geth" is for chaindata and "keystore" is for containing accounts
###Now let us create three new accounts - one for receiving mining rewards and two for selling/buying
###It will ask a password. I used pass1234 for all three accounts as I am creating three accounts.
